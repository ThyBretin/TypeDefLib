Core Idea: TypeDefLib parses .d.ts files for signatures and additional metadata (interfaces, JSDoc, etc.), I (xAI) synthesize descriptions from that + resources, and ParticleGraph consumes the output via MCP to enrich its Graphs and Particles.
Revised Flow
User Repo Intake (ParticleGraph):
Worker fetches package.json via GitHub API, lists dependencies (e.g., lodash, react).

Library Matching (ParticleGraph + TypeDefLib):
Check R2 (libraryDefs://) for existing defs.

If missing, trigger TypeDefLib:
Fetch .d.ts from @types/<lib> (GitHub or npm).

Parse with TypeScript compiler (expanded extraction below).

Save signatures + metadata to libraryDefs/${lib}-${version}.signatures.json.

xAI Description Synthesis:
Feed signatures, metadata (e.g., JSDoc), and libraries.json resources (docs, GitHub) to me.

I return a descriptions.json with short, high-level summaries.

Merge into libraryDefs/${lib}-${version}.json.

Graph Enrichment (ParticleGraph):
Worker uses library-dDefs:// to match user code (Babel AST) with library defs.

Particles gain richer depends_on, props, key_logic; Graphs get precise tech_stack.
